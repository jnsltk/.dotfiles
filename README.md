# .dotfiles

My configuration files for my linux machine. Feel free to use and modify anything!

**Some more details:**

## i3wm

Pretty much defaults for visuals. Contains mostly application startup commands,
and some other tweaks.

## Neovim

Initial config based on theprimeagen, but since then I added a lot of my own
modifications, plugins and keybindings.

## Kitty

Changed the font to JetBrains Mono

## Picom

To avoid screen tearing and get a nice transparent terminal

## Tmux

Changed and added a few keybindings, to make it work a bit more like vim
