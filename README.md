# .dotfiles

My configuration files for my linux machine. Mostly defaults in terms of looks,
because I just can't be bothered to change it. I don't care how my system
looks as long as it works exactly the way I want it to.

Feel free to use and modify anything!

**Some more details:**

## i3wm

Contains mostly application startup commands and some tweaks.

## Neovim

Initial config based on theprimeagen, but since then I added a lot of my own
modifications, plugins and keybindings. I use lazy.nvim for packages, and I 
try to organise everything neatly, although I might want to rework it some time.

## The rest

Mostly minor changes, little tweaks, and some scripts.
